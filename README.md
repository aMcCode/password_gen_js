### Random Password Generator
#
### This progam generates a password between 8-128 characters based on the following user specifications:
    * Number of characters b/w 8 and 128.
    * Whether to include lowercase letters.
    * Whether to include uppercase letters.
    * Whether to include numbers.
    * Whether to include special characters.
### Passwords are created by randomly selecting characters based on user responses and then scrambling the selected characters before presenting the password.

# Future enhancements:
  * Add a feature to allow for clearing the password box in support of a cleaner "do it again" flow.
  * If we really want to get fancy, use some form of encryption and statistical randomization to generate our passwords.
