 Future enhancements:
  --Log error messages earlier and skip out without asking for all responses (e.g. If invalid number, don't ask the char type questions.)
  --Add a feature to allow for clearing the password box in support of a cleaner "do it again" flow.
  --If we really want to get fancy, use some form of encryption and statistical randomization to generate our passwords.
